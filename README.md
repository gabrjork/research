# research

here i plan to make available the scripts I have used in my research to improve peer review and transparency. 

due to the fact that i am still developing my R skills, i've conducted the the most complex econometric tasks in EViews, as available in the wf.
(i should share the EViews files as well as soon as they're finished.)
