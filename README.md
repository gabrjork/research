# research

Here, I plan to make available the scripts used in my research to improve peer review and ensure transparency.

The R scripts were employed to retrieve data, build and manipulate the database for the VAR estimation, and to produce some additional figures included in my bachelorâ€™s thesis.

Since I am still developing my R skills, I had significant help from AI in writing the code and carried out the more complex econometric tasks in EViews. The corresponding .wf1 file is available above.

As an exception, the bank asset data was extracted manually from if.data and then organized in a spreadsheet using a Python script.

Once the final research is published, I will share a link to the university repository.


A quick guide: 
1st -> create a folder and extract the "ativo_2011" zip file. Save the "ativobancario.py" file in there;
2nd -> run the "LFT_database.r" file to get the data used in the model;

the remaining R scripts were used to get additional data that were not included in the model.
