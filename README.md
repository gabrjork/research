# research

Here, I plan to make available the scripts used in my research to improve peer review and ensure transparency.

The R scripts were employed to retrieve data, build and manipulate the database for the VECM estimation, and to produce some additional figures included in my bachelorâ€™s thesis.

Since I am still developing my R skills, I carried out the more complex econometric tasks in EViews. The corresponding .wf1 file is available above.

As an exception, the bank asset data was extracted manually from if.data and then organized in a spreadsheet using a Python script.

Once the thesis is published, I will share a link to the university repository.
