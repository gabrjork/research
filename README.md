# research

here i plan to make available the scripts I have used in my research to improve peer review and transparency. 

the R tools were used to retrieve data, build and manipulate the database for the estimation of the VECM 
and for some other individual figures used in my bachelor's thesis. 

due to the fact that i am still developing my R skills, i've conducted the most complex econometric tasks in EViews.
the wf1 file is available above. 

as an exception, the bank asset data was extracted from if.data manually and organized
in a spreadsheet with the help of a python script.

as soon as it is published, i will share an access link to the university repository
